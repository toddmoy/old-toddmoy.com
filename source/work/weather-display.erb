I added a vertical gradient between the location names and the date grid. It might need to be played up, but it would communicate the area is slideable.</p> <p>As the user slides, the gradient darkens. The date grid slides underneath with new items entering from the right. While scrolling, the settings button is removed. This helps prevent it from being inadvertently triggered. It also helps the UI look cleaner. Sliding would be indexed so that it snaps to ideal positions.</p>",
