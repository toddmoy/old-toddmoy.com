Though you may have never heard of them, its possible you've used OPOWER. If you've ever received home energy reports from your utility company that compares your usage to your neighbors', those might have been produced by OPOWER.

OPOWER combines big data and and behavioral science to help utility companies reduce energy consumption and improve their relationship with their customers. This helps consumers lower their energy use and costs, and significantly reduces carbon emissions. OPOWER is transforming the way the world approaches household energy conservation.

Viget partnered with the energy-efficiency startup to redesign their site and make it reflect the companyâ€™s changing product portfolio. We also used this opportunity to tell a better story about its updated behavioral technology platform.

I led the UX effort for this project, with close collaboration with Visual Designers.

<figure>
  <figcaption>To convey our ideas, I storyboarded the ambient video.<br />
  We also shot lo-fi placeholder video with an iPhone to get a better sense for how it would work.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>The platform graphic fixes into position as the user scrolls, offering a sense of context.<br />
  Clicking on a block within the graphic jumps the user to the relevant section.</figcaption>
