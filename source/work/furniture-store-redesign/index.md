The No. 1 retailer of furniture and bedding in the United States--_also the No. 1 selling brand of furniture in the world_--needed help redesigning their site. To do so, they reached out to Viget to better present their furniture, create content that would engage users, and envision what a move to eCommerce would look like.

I led the UX effort on this engagement with close interaction with Visual Designers.

## Research

I started off with a competitive assessment and user research. Based on interviews and survey data, we defined a set of personas that influenced  features and content.

</figure>

In addition to Google Analytics, we instrumented key pages of the site with Clicktale. This gave us a better sense about what interested users.

## Product Detail

In our designs, the furniture takes center stage and everything else is secondary. Our goal was to make the images as large as possible, while also keeping usability in mind. We wanted the user to be able to feel the weft of the fabric.

<figure>
  <figcaption>Product Detail. Tabbed sections help keep the content structured and easily accessible.</figcaption>

</figure>

  <figcaption>Product Detail wireframe and comp.</figcaption>

</figure>

We structured the reviews so that prospective customers would find the most value. In addition to the traditional comment box, we also solicit ratings and "bottom line" appraisals.

<figure>
  <figcaption>Product Reviews tab</figcaption>
  <img src="/assets/placeholder-800.svg" data-src="assets/product-detail-reviews.png" alt="Product reviews tab" />
</figure>

Support call deflection is also important. The Q &amp; A tab acts like a mini-knowledgebase, listing answers to common questions.

<figure>
  <figcaption>Product Questions &amp; Answers tab. <br />Answers can be shared among multiple products to help manage long-term maintenance.</figcaption>

</figure>

## Product Catalog

The Category listing allowed customers to browse and filter products. Promotions can be shown or hidden as needed, without disrupting the layout.

<figure>
  <figcaption>Category Listing. All left-hand menus are shown expanded but only a subset is expanded by default.</figcaption>
  <img src="/assets/placeholder-800.svg" data-src="assets/category.png" alt="Category wireframe." />
</figure>

Throughout the site, the user can open a Quickview to see more detail&mdash;or simply browse the results like a slideshow

<figure>
  <figcaption>We used a modal so that this component could be used anywhere products are shown.</figcaption>
  <img src="/assets/placeholder-800.svg" data-src="assets/quickview.png" alt="Quickview wireframe." />
</figure>

Customers looking to outfit their home in a certain aesthetic can browse furniture based on Collection. On Collection landing pages, we draw attention to the details that make this line of furniture unique. This helps build the user's furniture appreciation.

<figure>
  <figcaption>Collection landing page. Users can move laterally among the collections with ease.</figcaption>

## Get Inspired

We knew that many visitors come to the site not to purchase, but to window shop and get inspired. To increase this behavior, I designed a section that offers people redecorating ideas. The Ideas & Tips section offered categorized decorating articles, videos, and photos. Products could be embedded, offering a bridge to shop without being overly sales-y.

The content is easily sharable on Pinterest and other social media outlets, increasing inbound traffic.

## Our Furniture

We knew that many of their users purchased furniture infrequently. Many years pass between purchases and they rarely get comfortable with the process. So, we wanted to build furniture literacy.

The "Our Furniture" page reveals what makes their furniture so great. It showcases the attention-to-detail and quality that might otherwise be overlooked.This content helps fill the knowledge gap by giving the customer terms and concepts they can use to evaluate furniture.

<figure>
  <figcaption>The Our Furniture page is an interactive, brochure-like experience.</figcaption>
  <img src="/assets/placeholder-800.svg" data-src="assets/our-furniture.png" alt="Our Furniture wireframe." />
</figure>

<figure>
  <figcaption>When translated to design, the content comes alive.</figcaption>
  <img src="/assets/placeholder-800.svg" data-src="assets/our-furniture-composite.png" alt="Our Furniture wireframe and comp." />
</figure>

## Checkout

The checkout process was designed in close collaboration with the development team. The eCommerce vendor had been chosen and we set to work on making the experience solid, while minimizing the dev effort.

Ultimately, eCommerce was sidelined while they worked out business implications with their franchisees, but the work still remains.

<figure>
  <figcaption>Wishlist and Shopping Cart.</figcaption>
  <img src="/assets/placeholder-800.svg" data-src="assets/menu-wishlist-cart.png" alt="Wishlist and shopping cart" />
</figure>

The cart allows for warranty upsells--a big revenue driver--while not straying into the realm of dark patterns.

<figure>
  <figcaption>My Cart.</figcaption>
  <img src="/assets/placeholder-800.svg" data-src="assets/my-cart.png" alt="My Cart" />
</figure>

Guest checkout was allowed and we added a lazy-registration pattern to the end. This helps reduce the amount of friction in the checkout process.

## Search

We found that users were search-dominant, but their queries were often poor. We improved search by introducing keyword-based typeahead. This helped direct users toward queries with the best chance of success.

<figure>
  <figcaption>Search typeahead. <br />Keyword-based promotions offered a minimally intrusive way to market products.</figcaption>
  <img src="/assets/placeholder-800.svg" data-src="assets/menu-search.png" alt="Search typeahead with keyword-based promotion." />
</figure>

</figure>

## Find My Store

We made it easy for a user to find their local store from the utility navigation. Based on their location, we preselect the closest store to them. Users can also easily search for other stores by city or ZIP.

<figure>
  <figcaption>Hours, phone numbers, directions, and promotions were incorporated into the store listing.</figcaption>
  <img src="/assets/placeholder-800.svg" data-src="assets/menu-find-a-store.png" alt="Find a Store and My Local Store menus" />
