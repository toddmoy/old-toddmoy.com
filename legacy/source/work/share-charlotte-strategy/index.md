description: SHARE Charlotte, a local registry of volunteer opportunities, had a vision to enable organizations to create wishlists that donors could purchase from. The catch? They weren't sure whether it was a viable idea to invest in.

## Technical Research

The vision was to allow organizations to build wish lists of items from a variety of retailers, online and off. Our first step was to see if this idea was technically viable.

## A Dilemma

While we identified a technical solution, we weren't convinced it would be financially sustainable. While SC's motivations were not to make money, we did need to consider whether investing in technology was better than other users. There was an opportunity cost to consider.

Because referral margins are so low, SHARE Charlotte would need a exceptionally large amount of transactions to break even. But traffic to the site at this point was negligible and the market was small.

*Even if we built the best software possible, it might still fail.*

In our minds, there were a few unsolved significant variables:

1. Are enough people interested in the idea?
1. Of those, can we get them to the site?
1. Of those, can we convince enough people to buy enough things?

But how to do this without building a lot of software?

## Our Proposal

We advised a very lightweight MVP built on Amazon Wishlists and a little sweat equity. The site would include a new section--a _Marketplace_--that listed goods requested by the organizations.

It was all manual -- there would be no Amazon integration or CMS management.

Share Charlotte would identify a few prominent organizations and help them set up wish lists. This was key. By working with a small set, they could manage the workload and do more intentional traffic building campaigns.


## Additional work

We found a lot of problems on he site that needed to be addressed. These didn't relate directly to their initiative, but addressing them would only help their users' experience.
