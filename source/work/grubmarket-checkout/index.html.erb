      <p>GrubMarket is to local produce what Etsy is to handmade crafts. The online retailer allows consumers to shop direct from farmers and independent producersâ€”from the convenience of their phones. After noticing abandonment in their shopping cart, they asked Viget to redesign the flow for greater efficiency. As the UX lead, I simplified the checkout experience by rethinking the page architecture and reducing the amount of decisions and input needed.</p>
